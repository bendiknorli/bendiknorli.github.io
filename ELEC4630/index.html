                    During the work on assessment 2, I started working with
                    fastAI. After downloading and setting everything up, I
                    started of running the already made fastAI code for
                    classifying birds. Looking at the code, I saw how simple and
                    high-level fastAI is making it an effective language for
                    machine learning tasks.

                    src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/616548600/ae21fe11-2ab9-4556-bd6a-0566fc4474a2"
                    alt="fastAI"
                    class="image"
                    width="50%"
                />
                <p>
                    I learned how easy it is to collect and organize data with
                    fastAI's integration with tools like duckduckgo_search,
                    which allowed me to download images automatically from the
                    web without needing to search or organize them manually. I
                    have always seen data collection as a difficult and
                    time-consuming task but this made it a lot easier.

                    When it came to training the model, I discovered the
                    benefits of using a pre-trained model for learning new
                    connections. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model like
                    <a
                        href="https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html"
                        >ResNet18</a
                    >, we were able to quickly adapt it to bird recognizing with
                    only seconds of training. The process of fine-tuning in
                    fastAI was straightforward and efficient, and I was able to
                    get good results in a short time. Before, I have always
                    trained my models from scratch, which took a lot of time and
                    resources. Using pre-trained models therefore changed my
                    perspective on developing new models.

                    It was also my first time working with the DataBlock API,
                    which simplified the data preparation process. With it, the
                    dataset was easily split into training and validation sets,
                    correctly resized to the same sizes. DataLoaders were also
                    created all with minimal code.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Overall, I learned that fastAI is a crazy fast and easy way
                    to quickly set up and train a neural network.
