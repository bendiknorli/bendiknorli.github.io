                <h2>Part 1: Fun with Filters</h2>
                <h3>Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator</h3>
                <p>
                    Here is the first image of the project which is a cameraman.
                </p>
                <img src="images/task1-1.png" alt="Task 1.1" />
                <p>
                    I took the derivate of the image in both the x and y
                    direction by using the convolve2d method from the scipy
                    library with a derivate in each direction:
                    <br />
                    D_x = [[1, -1]]
                </p>
                <img src="images/task1-1x.png" alt="Task 1.1 x-derivative" />
                <br />
                <p>D_y = [[1], [-1]]</p>
                <img src="images/task1-1y.png" alt="Task 1.1 y-derivative" />
                <p>
                    I then calculated the gradient by taking computing the
                    convolution over the image with the x and y derivatives and
                    then taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the
                    two derivatives:
                    <br />
                    Gradient Magnitude = sqrt((convolve_x^2 + convolve_y^2))
                </p>
                <img src="images/task1-1gradient.png" alt="Task 1.1 gradient" />

                <p>
                    I then set a binary threshold of 0.2 to only show pixels
                    values that were higher than 0.2. This made the edges in the
                    image more visible:
                </p>
                <img src="images/task1-1binarized.png" alt="Task 1.1 binery" />

                <h3>Part 1.2: Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) Filter</h3>
                <p>
                    To make the filters less noisy, I now applied a gaussian
                    filter to the image. I now got a blurred image by creating a
                    gaussian kernel and convolving it with the image.
                </p>
                <img src="images/task1-2blur.png" alt="Task 1.2 blurred" />

                <p>
                    When we now compute the gradient of the image and binarize
                    as before, we can see that the edges are much clearer and
                    that we get far less noise compared to before.
                </p>
                <img src="images/task1-2gradient.png" alt="Task 1.2 gradient" />

                <p>
                    To do the same with a single convolution, I created a 2d
                    gaussian by taking the outer product between two 1d
                    gaussians. Then I convolved D_x and D_y with the 2d gaussian
                    to get blurred derivatives. When we then calculate the
                    gradient with the blurred derivates, we can see that we get
                    the same result as before without needing to blend before.
                </p>
                <img
                    src="images/task1-2gradient_DoG.png"
                    alt="Task 1.2 blurred 2"
                />

                <h2>Part 2: Fun with Frequencies!</h2>
                <h3>Part 2.1: Image "Sharpening"</h3>
                <p>
                    Next, I implemented a sharpening filter by subtracting the
                    blurred image from the original image and adding the result
                    to the original image. Adding more of the higher frequencies
                    makes the edges more visible which gives the illusion of the
                    image being sharper.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To make this procedure even more streamlined I rewrote the
                    code to calculate the unsharp filter mask by using the
                    formula:
                    <br />
                    f*((1+a)e -ag)
                    <br />
                    Here f represents the input image, a is a scaling factor
                    that controls the sharpness intensity, e is the unit
                    impulse, and g represents the gaussian.
                </p>

                    I then blurred an image of cobblestone and sharpened it
                    again to be able to see how the sharpening affects the
                    image.

                <p>
                    As we can see, the image is much clearer after we unsharpen
                    it. However, it does not look the same as the original
                    image. The original image is more detailed. While the
                    unsharpened image detects edges, it is not able to revover
                    the details that were present in the original image. When we
                    unsharpen the image, we are therefore not able to reproduce
                    the original image but we rather get an sharp image but with
                    less detail.
                </p>

                <br />

                <h3>Part 2.2: Hybrid Images</h3>
                <p>
                    In this part I created a hybrid image by combining a
                    low-pass filtered image with a high-pass filtered image. The
                    low-pass filtered image was created by convolving the image
                    with a gaussian filter and the high-pass filtered image was
                    created by subtracting the low-pass filtered image from the
                    original image just as before.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                    Additionally, I implemented a cutoff frequency to be able to
                    control the amount of high and low frequencies in the image.
                    This was done by setting the amount of cycles the kernel
                    would go through per image in the gaussian filtering as
                    described in the paper. In this way, we could set a low
                    cutoff frequency to remove most of the high frequencies to
                    get a blurry image or a high cutoff frequency to keep most
                    of the high frequencies and get a sharper image. The
                    opposite goes for the high-pass filter.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                    Below are the results of the hybrid images I created. The
                    first image of Derek and Nutmeg looks like Derek up close
                    but like Nutmeg from a distance. The second image of the
                    elephant and tiger looks like an elephant up close but like
                    a tiger from a distance. And the third image of the orange
                    and the bald man looks like an orange up close but like a
                    bald man from a far.
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                    However, the last image of the happy and angry man failed
                    where the man always looks angry. This is most likely
                    because the cutoff frequencies were set in a bad which goes
                    to show how important the cutoff frequencies are to get a
                    satisfactory result. Additionally, it may be that the
                    features in the images that make the man look angry are
                    always a little visible which dominates the facial
                    expression making the man look angry even though you see
                    more of the happy face.
                </p>

                    Even though I'm quite happy with the bald man and the
                    orange, I still think Derek and the cat is the hybrid image
                    that looks the best so I'll show the frequency plots for
                    those.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    First off, after taking the Fourier transform, we have the
                    frequency plot for the images before the high-pass and
                    low-pass filtering. We can see that the cat has a lot of
                    diagonal lines which explains the fact that the image is
                    tilted. Derek on the other hand only has the horizontal and
                    vertical which can be explained by the fact that the image
                    doesn't have that many patterns except for the straight
                    lines of the background and the face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After filtering the images, we can see that Nutmeg has
                    stayed mostly the same. However, Derek has now gotten a lot
                    of horizontal and vertical lines spread across the Fourier
                    space. This is because the high-pass filter has removed most
                    of the low frequencies in the image.

                    The hybrid image is a combination of the high-pass and
                    low-pass filtered images. We can see that the image is a
                    combination of the horizontal and vertical lines from Derek
                    and the diagonal lines from Nutmeg. This is because the
                    high-pass filter has removed the diagonal lines from Derek
                    and the low-pass filter has removed the horizontal and
                    vertical lines from Nutmeg.

                <h3>Part 2.3: Gaussian and Laplacian Stacks</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a gaussian stack, I convolved the input image with
                    a gaussian with a kernel width of 40 pixels and a sigma of
                    5. I then added the result to the stack. I repeated the
                    process on the resulting image. I did this 5 times to get a
                    stack of 5 gaussian blurred images.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    For the laplacian stack, I subtracted the gaussian blurred
                    image from the next gaussian blurred image in the stack to
                    get the high frequencies in the images.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I created a mask with 0's on the left side and 1's on the
                    right side. I then created a gaussian stack for the mask and
                    multiplied the mask with the laplacian stack on each level
                    get a blended image on each level.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Due to normalization errors, the colors of the images are
                    off. The gaussian blur also blurs the edges of the mask
                    which makes the stages look weird.

                <h3>Part 2.4: Multiresolution Blending (a.k.a. the oraple!)</h3>
                <p>
                    For the multiresolution blending, I started by scaling the
                    images to the same size. I then created a gaussian stack for
                    the mask and used the formula
                    <br />
                    blended image = mask * image1 + (1 - mask) * image2
                    <br />
                    to blend the two images together on each of the layers in
                    the laplacian stacks. In the end, I summed the layers in the
                    laplacian stack to get the final blended image. This gave me
                    this result.
                </p>

                <img src="images/task2-3blended_image.png" alt="Task 2.4" />

                <br />

                <p>
                    For the irregular mask, I used the PolygonSelector library
                    to manually create a mask around the objects in the images I
                    wanted to blend. This worked by showing the image and
                    letting the user click points that were going to make up the
                    mask. To finish the mask, you could select the first point
                    again. The mask was then created by filling the polygon with
                    1's and the rest with 0's. To get a smooth transition
                    between the mask and the rest of the image, I aslo gaussian
                    blurred the mask. I got a much better result when using the
                    GaussianBlur function from the cv2 library in this task so I
                    used that instead of the gaussian blend I created in a
                    previous task.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    For the Peter Parker and Spiderman image, I noticed that
                    choosing a mask that both would fit the face of Peter Parker
                    and the face of Spiderman was difficult. I therefore chose
                    to make it possible to select points for the mask in both
                    images. The masks are then added together to get the final
                    mask and the procedure from there is the same as before.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>The result of the blending can be seen below.</p>
