          Using homographies to rectify images and creating panorama images
        </p>

        <h2>Part A: Computing Homographies</h2>
        <p>
          To align the images for both the mosaic and rectification, I needed to
          compute the homography matrix between the images. The homography
          defines the transformation between two perspectives of the same scene,
          which can be used to map points from one image to the other.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The homography matrix is a 3x3 matrix that represents a projective
          transformation. We want to recover this projective transformation such
          that
        </p>

          alt="Homography Matrix"
          width="50%"
        />

        <p>If we expand this out, we have the following system of equations:</p>

          src="images/equations/eq2.png"
          alt="System of Equations"
          width="50%"
        />

        <p>Expanding this further:</p>

          src="images/equations/eq3.png"
          alt="Expanded Homography"
          width="50%"
        />

        <p>Which simplifies to:</p>

          src="images/equations/eq4.png"
          alt="Simplified System"
          width="50%"
        />

        <p>This gives us the following system of linear equations:</p>

        <h3>Rectification</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure the homography matrix was calculated corectly, I took a
          picture of a square painting from an angle. I then manually selected
          four corner points from the painting in the image with the tool from
          the previous student. Then, I mapped those points to a perfect square
          which in this case was [0, 0], [0, 100], [100, 0], [100, 100] to
          compute the homography. I then inverse warped the image using the
          inverse of the homography matrix and bilinear interpolation where the
          pixels mapped between multiple pixels. Here are the points I selected
          on the painting and the result after warping the image in to the
          square:

        <h3>Warping for the Mosaic</h3>
        <p>
          For the mosaicing, I took three photos of I-House overlapping each
          other by about 60%. Here I made sure to keep the camera fixed in one
          location and rotating it around its own axis to make the center of
          projection the same for all images.

          Afterward, I manually selected a bunch of points for correspondences
          between the left and middle image and the right and middle image.

          Using the same warping funciton as before, I warped the images into
          three separate canvases, all with the same dimentions.

        <h3>Blending the Images into a Mosaic</h3>
        <p>
          To then combine the images onto one canvas and smooth the transitions
          over them together, I first created an alpha mask for the middle image
          by setting 1 at the center and gradually decreasing to 0 at the edges
          by using euclidean distance from the center. I then multiplied this
          mask with the pixel values of the middle image to ensure a smooth
          transition between the warped images on the side and the middle image.
        </p>

            <p class="image-text">Middle Canvas with Alpha Mask</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I then computed the weighted average of the three images by combining
          the pixel values from all images, using the total weight map to
          normalize the pixel intensities. By using this weight map, I got all
          the pixel values to a weighted average of all the overlapping images.
          This produced a smooth transition between the overlapping images.
          After cropping the image to remove the black edges, I got this final
          blended panorama.

          src="images/i-house-mosaic.png"

        <p>
          I then did the exact same procedure for these three images of haas and
          the street next to it.

        <h2>Part B: Feature Matching and Autostitching</h2>
        <h3>Harris points</h3>
        <p>
          To start implementing the autostitching, I used the sample code given
          in the project to detect the harris interest points. This made me get
          this result.
        </p>
        <img src="images/harris-points.png" alt="Harris Points" width="50%" />
        <h3>Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression</h3>
        <p>
          As we can see, getting all the harris interest points results in a lot
          of points. To reduce the number of points, I used the Adaptive
          Non-Maximal Suppression algorithm to get the interest points that were
          both spread out and had a high corner response. I did this by first
          sorting the harris points by their strength. For each point, I then
          found all points that were stronger than the current point, even after
          mulitplying by a c_robust factor of 0.9. I stored the distance r_i to
          the closest point in a list. This process can be described with the
          following equation:
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/equations/ri_equation.png"
          alt="Ri Equation"
          width="50%"
        />
        <p>
          With this list of distances, I sorted it and select the stronger
          points that were the furthest away from each other. For the amount of
          points, I selected 500 as in the paper which resulted in the following
          image.
        </p>
        <img src="images/anms-points.png" alt="ANMS Points" width="50%" />
        <h3>Feature Descriptor extraction</h3>
        <p>
          The next step now was to get feature descriptors for the points in
          each image. To do this, I looped over every 5th pixel around the image
          in a 36x36 grid to get a 8x8 descriptor for each point. I then
          normalized it by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard
          deviation of the descriptor. This gave me descriptors that looked like
          this:
        </p>
        <div class="images-container">
          <div class="image-container">
            <img
              src="images/descriptor_unnormalized.png"
              alt="Descriptor 1"
              width="100%"
            />
            <p class="image-text">Descriptor before normalization</p>
          </div>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/descriptor3.png" alt="Descriptor 3" width="100%" />
            <p class="image-text">Descriptor after normalization</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <img
          src="images/descriptor_collection.png"
          alt="Descriptor Collection"
          width="100%"
        />
        <h3>Feature Matching</h3>
        <p>
          After getting the descriptors, I then matched the descriptors between
          the two images by first normalizing the descriptors and then computing
          the euclidean distance between them. I could then sort the distances
          so that I had a list of the the descriptors that were the most
          similar. I then took the two first entries in this list which were the
          first and second nearest neighbor and kept all the matches that
          satisfied the Lowe's ratio test. This test was done by taking the
          ratio of the distance between the first and second nearest neighbor to
          make sure it was both a good and unique match. This gave me the
          following matches:
        </p>

            />
            <p class="image-text">Matches between left and middle image</p>

            <p class="image-text">Matches between right and middle image</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>RANSAC</h3>
        <p>
          I now had the matches between the images, but as we see on the images
          above, some of the matches are still off. To fix this, I implemented
          the RANSAC algorithm to find the inliers in the matches. I did this by
          first randomly selecting 4 matches and computing the homography matrix
          between them. I then used this matrix to warp the points from the
          first image to the second image and checked if the distance between
          the warped points and the actual points were less than a threshold of
          1 pixel away from each other. I then counted the amount of inliers and
          kept the homography matrix that had the most inliers. I then ended up
          with these inliers:
