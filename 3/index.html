                    I used the tool made by a previous student to define the
                    correspondences between the two faces. Now I could compute
                    the mean of the two sets of landmarks and compute the
                    triangulation of the mean by using the Delaunay function
                    from the scipy library.

                <h2>Part 2. Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h2>
                <p>
                    The next step was to compute the "mid-way face" between the
                    two faces. I did this by looping over all the triangles in
                    the triangulation warping each one to where it would be in
                    the mid-way face. This was done by generating a mask around
                    a triangle, computing the affine transformation matrix, and
                    then applying the inverse of the transformation to the
                    triangle on the mid-way image to get the pixel value of the
                    corresponding pixel in the starting image.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    For the affine matrix, we have to solve the equation system
                    that maps the three coordinates in the start triangle to the
                    three coordinates in the mid-way triangle. For each point in
                    the mid-way triangle, we can express the x and y coordinates
                    as follows:
                    <br />
                    xi' = a*x + b*y + c
                    <br />
                    yi' = d*x + e*y + f
                    <br />
                    For all three points in the triangle, we then get six
                    equations in total which we can set up in a matrix. Given
                    that we know the start and mid-way coordinates we can now
                    solve the system.
                </p>
                <img
                    src="images/affine_matrix_setup.png"
                    alt="Affine Matrix Setup"
                    width="50%"
                />
                <p>
                    When we have computed a, b, c, d, e, and f, we can then put
                    it in the Affine matrix together with a 1 in the last column
                    on the bottom row which makes it homogenous.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To perform the inverse warping with the affine matrix, we
                    first have to compute which pixels are inside the triangle
                    and make the coordinates homogenous. You can then matrix
                    multiply the inverse of the affine matrix with the list of
                    the coordinates inside the triangle to get the coordinate of
                    the corresponding pixel in the starting image. We now have a
                    mapping from the mid-way image to the starting image so we
                    can fill in the pixel values in the mid-way image. To get
                    the correct pixel value of the corresponding pixel however,
                    we have to use bilinear interpolation since the pixel we are
                    looking for might be in between up to four pixels. We
                    therefore have to take the weighted average of the four
                    pixels around the pixel we are looking for to get the
                    correct pixel value.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Finally, we can add all the warped triangles together to get
                    the images fully warped to the mid-way face. To then
                    actually compute the mid-way face, I then computed the mean
                    of the two images which here means taking the average of
                    each pixel value. That gave me this result.

                <h2>Part 3. The Morph Sequence</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to making the morphing sequence, I implemented
                    a morph function that would compute a morphed image for a
                    given warp and dissolve value. These values represented how
                    many percent the first image would warp into the second one.
                    Here 0 would be the first image, 0.5 would be the mid-way
                    face, and 1 would be the second image.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To then create the morphing sequence, I looped over a range
                    of linearly distributed warp and dissolve values and
                    computed the morphed image for each pair of values. I then
                    saved all the images in a list and could then use the
                    imageio library to save the images as a gif. Before saving
                    the images, I also made sure to add all the frames in
                    reverse order to make the morphing sequence loop seamlessly.

                <h2>Part 4. The "Mean face" of a population</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose to compute the mean face over the
                    <a href="https://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html"
                        >FEIFace Database</a
                    >. The database only had landmarks for the spatially
                    normalized and not cropped images which were in black and
                    white, but I first made all the images 3D to make sure my
                    algorithm also would work on color images. I used the first
                    100 images and added one point for each corner to the
                    landmarks on each face to make sure the background also
                    would show in the mean image. I then computed the mean face
                    by warping all the images to the mean triangulation and then
                    taking the average of all the images. This gave me the
                    following mean face.
                </p>
                <img src="images/mean_face.png" alt="Mean Face" width="100%" />
                <p>
                    When I had the average face, I could then warp the faces
                    from the database into the average face. This gave me the
                    following result.

                <p>
                    To warp then warp my own face to the mean face, I first had
                    to label my own face in the same way that the faces in the
                    database were labeled. I therefore checked the landmarks of
                    the first image in the dataset and added the same landmarks
                    on my own face with the same tool as before.

                    I then warped myself into the mean face by using the same

                <p>
                    As we can see, the image of me warped to the mean face has
                    visible lines in between the warped triangles. This is
                    likeley due to the fact that this image is smaller which
                    makes it more visible when two warped pixels lands on top of
                    one another. This could be resolbed by using a better
                    interpolation method than bilinear interpolation or by using
                    a higher resolution image. You could also create a mask of
                    all the lines and perform a Gaussian blur on them to make
                    them less visible. Another way could be to compute a rolling
                    mean over the image to make outliers like these dissapear.

                <h2>Part 5. Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean</h2>
                <p>
                    For the extrapolation, I first computed the difference
                    between the points on my face and the mean face. Then I was
                    able to add or subtract however much of this difference I
                    wanted to my face to make my face look either closer to or
                    further away from the mean face. The amount was controlled
                    by a factor alpha between -2 and 2 with the following
                    formula:
                    <br />
                    new_shape = my_face + alpha * (my_face - mean_face)
                    <br />
                    This made me get the following results.

                <p>
                    As we can see on the first few images, there are these thick
                    bright lines going across the image. This is due to the fact
                    that the side of my face is getting more pushed into the
                    middle than my eye brows. This makes parts of the face
                    overlap when the image is warped. The result is that the
                    colors are added together which makes the colors much
                    brighter. To solve this issue, you could do edge detection
                    when you are warping the image. Another fix could also be to
                    use better labels whereas the ones that are used now makes
                    some lables like the eye brow and the side of the face
                    really close and therefore makes them likely to overlap.
                    However, we see that the mathematical model is working as
                    intended.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Analyzing the results, we can see that my face is thinner
                    than the average sinse my face is getting wider when we add
                    more of the average image and thinner when we subtract more
                    of the average image. However, my face is also longer away
                    from the camera than the faces in the dataset which makes my
                    face big in general when we add more of the mean face.

                <h2>Bells and Whistles: Changing ethnicity of my face</h2>
                <p>
                    For the bells and whistels I chose to change the look of my
                    face into the look of a mongolian man. To do this I found a
                    picture of the mean face of a group of mongolian men found
                    on
                    <a

                        >this blog</a
                    >. I then cropped my image to fit the same size as the mean
                    face of the mongolian mean.

                    I then morphed my face into the mongolian face by using the
                    warped method from earlier with 1 as the warp value and 0 as
                    the dissolve value to get my face morphed with just the
                    mongolian shape. I then morphed my face with a warp value of
                    0 and a dissolve value of 0.5 to get the color of the
                    mongolian face but still have my face in there. To get the
                    final result with both the shape and color of the mongolian
                    face, I then morphed the two images together with a warp
                    value of 1 and a dissolve value of 0.5. This gave me the
                    following results.
